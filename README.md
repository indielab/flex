# Flex

A WIP toolkit for fuzzy logic, this library includes functions for creating fuzzy variables, fuzzy sets, rules and a FLS.

**TODO: Refactor.**

## Usage

In `test/system_test.exs` there is an example of use, that is based on this [example](http://robotics.ee.uwa.edu.au/courses/faulttolerant/notes/FT5.pdf)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `flex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:flex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/flex](https://hexdocs.pm/flex).
